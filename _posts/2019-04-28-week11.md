# Week 11 Blog Post

## Contributions to the group project

This week, I was very active in the Vue.js community. After helping examine one of the bugs posted regarding JavaScript hooks, I helped investigate an issue that had been active for a long time before coming up with a workaround. I also began a discussion on the Vue forum for translating documentation into Mandarin for the Chinese Vue community. Together, Billy and I were able to translate some of the text into Mandarin, and had our pull requests approved. Additionally, I also started a discussion in the Vue Discord looking for more bugs and documentation to fix. Overall, although the standard for contributions in the Vue community is still extremely high, I was able to make some meaningful contributions.

This week, I'll continue working on the JavaScript issue and looking for documentation to translate into Chinese. Billy and I should be ready to present for our May 6th date.
