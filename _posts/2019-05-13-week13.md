# Week 13 Blog Post

## Group Project Contributions

I got my pull request for a previous documentation fix approved, and in the last week of 
the semester I will continue to look for any potential translations and bug gardening opportunities. The pull request 
in question did not pass all the checks previously required of it, but I fixed all the discrepancies between my branch
and the master branch, so it is all good to go now.
